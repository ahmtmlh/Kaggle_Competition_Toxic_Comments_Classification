# Kaggle_Competition_Toxic_Comments_Classification
Classify the data from a huge size of Wikipedia comments which have been labeled by human raters for toxic behavior.

The types of toxicity are:
- toxic
- severe_toxic
- obscene
- threat
- insult
- identity_hate

I created a model in Matlab which predicts a probability of each type of toxicity for each comment.
